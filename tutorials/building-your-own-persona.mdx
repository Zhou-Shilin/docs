## Read this first: soul vs task instructions

A soul is a long-lived identity.
It should answer: who is this agent, how does it feel, and how does it talk with players.

Use other places for task logic:

- Gameplay goals: normal chat prompts.
- Operational policy: team docs or command workflows.
- Runtime behavior switches: `/mineclawd config ...`.

If you put operational scripts inside soul files, personality quality drops and replies become stiff.

## How MineClawd loads personas

- Souls are markdown files in `mineclawd/souls/`.
- Built-in souls are `default` and `yuki`.
- Active soul selection is stored per owner in `mineclawd/souls/.active/<owner>.txt`.
- If a selected soul cannot be read, MineClawd falls back to `default`.

This lets you iterate safely without breaking the server experience.

## Use `yuki` as your benchmark

The bundled `yuki` soul demonstrates a strong pattern:

1. Clear identity.
2. Stable personality traits.
3. Distinct speaking style.
4. Interaction rules for failure and success.
5. Character continuity ("never break character").

Use this structure when creating your own advanced persona.

## Advanced authoring workflow

1. Pick one persona goal.
Example: `calm architect mentor` or `strict survival coach`.
2. Create a soul file, for example `mineclawd/souls/architect-mentor.md`.
3. Write identity, personality, speaking style, and interaction behavior.
4. Activate it:

```bash
/mineclawd persona architect-mentor
```

5. Run a fixed prompt set each revision so style differences are measurable.
6. Revise one section at a time, not the whole file at once.
7. Keep versioned snapshots while tuning.

## Soul template for advanced use

```md
### Role & Identity
You are [character name], [world role], helping players in Minecraft.

### Personality
1. [Trait with emotional intent]
2. [Trait with social intent]
3. [Trait with problem-solving intent]

### Speaking Style
- Tone: [short definition]
- Rhythm: [answer length and formatting preference]
- Signature language: [small phrase habits, language adaptation rules]

### Interaction Guidelines
- When user is stuck: [comfort + action pattern]
- When user succeeds: [celebration pattern]
- When user is vague: [clarification style]
- Never break character.
```

## Quality checks before release

| Check | What to verify |
| --- | --- |
| Character consistency | The same persona appears across different tasks and sessions. |
| Emotional behavior | Failure and success responses match your intended personality. |
| Language flexibility | Tone remains recognizable across English and other languages. |
| Drift resistance | Long chats do not collapse into generic assistant voice. |
| Community fit | Persona behavior matches your server culture and moderation rules. |

## Multiplayer persona strategy

- Active persona is per owner key, not global.
- Two operators can run different personas on the same server.
- Keep shared soul files in version control for team consistency.
- Use clear names like `mentor-calm`, `builder-energetic`, `admin-formal`.
- Add a short README near soul files so new operators know intended usage.
