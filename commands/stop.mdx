## Purpose

Cancel the currently running request for your session.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd stop
```

## When to use it

- A request is taking too long and you want to abort.
- MineClawd is stuck in a tool-call loop.
- You changed your mind about a request mid-generation.

## What it does

1. Marks the active request as cancelled.
2. Cancels in-flight network requests to the LLM provider.
3. Cleans up any pending `ask-user-question` prompts.
4. Frees the session so you can send a new request.

## GUI alternative

While a request is running, the overlay input bar shows a **Stop** button (circle with square icon) in place of the **Send** button. Clicking it has the same effect as running `/mineclawd stop`.

## Behavior and limits

- If no request is running, the command does nothing.
- Partial responses that streamed before cancellation remain in the session history.
- The session stays on the same active session after cancellation.

## Common failures

- `No active request to cancel` -- no generation is currently running for your session.
