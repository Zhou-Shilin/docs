title: "persona"
description: "Show available souls or switch to a different soul persona."
---

## Purpose

Use this command to inspect or switch your active soul persona.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd persona
/mineclawd persona <soul>
```

## What it does

- Without args: shows active soul and available soul names.
- With `<soul>`: switches active soul for your owner key.

## Examples

```bash
/mineclawd persona
/mineclawd persona yuki
/mineclawd persona builder
```

## Behavior and limits

- Soul names are read from `mineclawd/souls/*.md`.
- Active selection is stored per owner in `mineclawd/souls/.active/`.
- Persona switching is blocked while a request is running.

## Common failures

- `persona not found`: verify name with `/mineclawd persona`.
- `cannot switch persona while a request is running`: wait for completion.

For soul authoring, see [/configuration/souls](/configuration/souls).
