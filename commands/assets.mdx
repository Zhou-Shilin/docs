## Purpose

Manage the asset records that MineClawd creates when building things in your world.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd assets list
/mineclawd assets teleport <asset>
/mineclawd assets give <asset>
/mineclawd assets remove-record <asset>
```

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list` | Show all tracked assets for the current owner. |
| `teleport <asset>` | Teleport to an entity asset's stored location. |
| `give <asset>` | Give yourself the item or block tied to the asset. |
| `remove-record <asset>` | Delete the tracking record without touching the world. |

## When to use it

- Use `list` to see everything MineClawd has created across sessions.
- Use `teleport` to find entities that were summoned at specific coordinates.
- Use `give` to obtain items or blocks that MineClawd registered.
- Use `remove-record` to clean up stale records after manual world changes.

## Behavior and limits

- `teleport` only works for entity-category assets with a stored UUID, dimension, and coordinates.
- `give` works for Items/Blocks/Fluids (by content ID) and Special Items (by special item ID and NBT).
- `remove-record` only removes the tracking record. It does not delete the entity, item, or script from the world.
- Asset records are scoped per owner, same as sessions.

## GUI alternative

Open the overlay menu and click **Assets** to browse records with category filters and per-entry action buttons. See [tracking assets](/tutorials/tracking-assets) for a walkthrough.

## Common failures

- `Asset not found` -- the asset ID does not match any stored record. Run `list` first.
- `Cannot teleport to this asset` -- the asset is not an entity or does not have stored location data.
- `Cannot give this asset` -- the asset has no content ID or special item ID.
