## Purpose

Show or hide the AssistiveTouch floating orb for your player without disabling the entire GUI system.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd assistivetouch
```

## When to use it

- You want to temporarily hide the orb from your screen.
- You prefer to open the overlay only through other means (like the Sessions or Assets menu commands).

## What it does

Toggles the AssistiveTouch orb visibility for your player. Run once to hide, run again to show.

This setting is stored per player in `mineclawd/player-settings.json` and persists across sessions.

## Behavior and limits

- The toggle is per-player, not global.
- Hiding the orb does not disable the overlay. If the overlay is already open, it stays open.
- The orb is only visible to players with OP level 2, regardless of this toggle.
- Default state is visible (enabled).
