## Purpose

Show your saved sessions so you can resume, remove, or repair them.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd sessions
/mineclawd sessions list
```

## What you get

The list includes:

- session id
- session title
- session token
- last updated time
- active marker

## Examples

```bash
/mineclawd sessions list
```

## Behavior and limits

- Sessions are scoped by owner key.
- Player executions use player UUID as owner key.
- Console executions use `server` as owner key.

## Common failures

- If you see no sessions, create one with `/mineclawd sessions new`.
