## What a soul is

A soul is MineClawd's character sheet.
It defines who the agent is, how it talks, and how it behaves with people.

Think of it as personality, not a task script.

- Good soul content: identity, temperament, tone, and social behavior.
- Bad soul content: long command recipes, tool instructions, or one-off workflow steps.

<Note>
Even if a soul uses a different character name, project and tool identity still remain MineClawd.
</Note>

## Built-in souls

MineClawd ships with:

- `default`
- `yuki`

`yuki` is the mascot-style soul and a good structure reference.

## Soul file locations

- Soul directory: `mineclawd/souls/`
- Active soul pointer per owner: `mineclawd/souls/.active/<owner>.txt`

Each operator can keep a different active soul on the same server.

## Show and switch souls

```bash
/mineclawd persona
/mineclawd persona yuki
/mineclawd persona default
```

<Info>
You cannot switch souls while a request is running.
Wait for completion, then run `/mineclawd persona <soul>`.
</Info>

## Create a custom soul

1. Create a markdown file in `mineclawd/souls/`, for example `mineclawd/souls/mentor.md`.
2. Write persona content with the structure below.
3. Run `/mineclawd persona mentor`.
4. Send a few normal prompts and refine the voice.

## Soul writing template

```md
### Role & Identity
You are [name], [short identity].

### Personality
1. [Core trait 1]
2. [Core trait 2]
3. [Core trait 3]

### Speaking Style
- Tone: [friendly/calm/playful/etc.]
- Verbal habits: [short phrases, occasional catchphrases, etc.]
- Language behavior: [how you adapt to user language]

### Interaction Guidelines
- When user is stuck: [comfort + recovery behavior]
- When user succeeds: [celebration behavior]
- Never break character.
```

## Practical tips

- Keep emotional tone consistent across all sections.
- Prefer concrete voice cues over vague adjectives.
- Keep operational behavior in prompts and docs, not in soul files.
- Read bundled `yuki.md` before designing your own soul.
