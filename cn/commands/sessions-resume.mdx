title: "sessions resume"
description: "Switch the active session by id or token."
---

## Purpose

Make an older session active again so new requests continue that context.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd sessions resume <session>
```

`<session>` can be:

- session id, such as `1a2b`
- session token, such as `1a2b-my-project-title`

## Examples

```bash
/mineclawd sessions resume 1a2b
/mineclawd sessions resume 1a2b-my-project-title
```

## Behavior and limits

- Resuming does not edit history. It only switches active session pointer.
- Use `/mineclawd sessions list` first if you are not sure which reference to use.

## Common failures

- `session not found`: use exact id or token from list output.
- `cannot switch sessions while a request is running`: wait for completion.
