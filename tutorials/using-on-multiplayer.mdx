## Deployment model

- Install MineClawd on the server to enable `/mineclawd` and `/mclawd`.
- Client install is optional for core command usage.
- Client install is required for:
  - `/mineclawd config` GUI open packet
  - `/mineclawd history` book UI
  - Popup question UI for `ask-user-question`
  - The overlay GUI (AssistiveTouch orb, streaming view, session/asset management)

<Info>
If a player does not have the client mod, MineClawd still has a fallback question flow in chat (`/mineclawd choose ...`). All commands work through chat without the overlay.
</Info>

## Permission model and admin control

- MineClawd command roots are gated by vanilla permission level `2` (`source.hasPermissionLevel(2)`).
- There are no built-in custom permission nodes per subcommand.
- Practical result: grant OP to trusted operators only.

If your server stack supports command-level permission remapping, expose `/mineclawd` and `/mclawd` only to your AI-operator role.

## Visibility controls for busy servers

MineClawd has a per-player visibility setting:

```bash
/mineclawd config broadcast-requests-to <self|all|ops>
```

- `self`: only the requester sees prompt echo and task status.
- `all`: everyone sees it.
- `ops`: only operators see it.

This setting is stored in `mineclawd/player-settings.json` and is scoped per player UUID.

It can be also set in the GUI config screen, inside the "Misc" section, as "Broadcast requests to".

## Session ownership in multiplayer

- Session data is isolated per owner key.
- Player commands operate on that player's own session set.
- Console commands use a separate owner namespace.

For team operations, decide early whether each operator keeps personal sessions or everyone shares one operator account.

## Dynamic registry on dedicated servers

By default, `dynamic-registry-mode` is `AUTO`. In `AUTO`, dynamic placeholder runtime is disabled on dedicated servers.

To force-enable it:

```bash
/mineclawd config dynamic-registry-mode enabled
```

Then restart the server.

### What changes when enabled

- Dynamic placeholders for item/block/fluid slots become available at runtime.
- Dynamic state sync is sent to clients.
- Persistent world state stores dynamic slot data.
- Clients must also install MineClawd to join this dedicated server.

<Warning>
Enable dynamic registry on production servers only after a staged test. The client requirement is a hard compatibility change for all players.
</Warning>

## Recommended operator baseline

| Goal | Suggested setting |
| --- | --- |
| Reduce chat noise | `broadcast-requests-to ops` |
| Prevent long tool loops | `limit-tool-calls true` |
| Keep loops bounded | `tool-call-limit 8` to `12` |
| Debug incidents only | `debug-mode true` temporarily |

## Rollout checklist for server owners

1. Pick your operator role and OP policy first.
2. Set provider and model credentials.
3. Set broadcast policy (`self`, `ops`, or `all`).
4. Decide whether dynamic registry stays `auto` or changes to `enabled`.
5. Test with two real accounts (operator and non-operator) before public launch.
