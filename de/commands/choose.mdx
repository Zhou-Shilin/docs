title: "choose"
description: "Answer a pending MineClawd clarification question."
---

## Purpose

Respond to pending `ask-user-question` prompts from MineClawd.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd choose
/mineclawd choose <option>
```

`<option>` can be:

- `1`, `2`, `3`, ... (preset option index)
- `other` (enter custom chat text)
- `skip` (continue without answer)
- `cancel` (cancel pending custom text input)

## Example flow

```bash
/mineclawd choose 2
/mineclawd choose other
# type your custom answer in normal chat within 60 seconds
```

## Behavior and limits

- This command must be executed by a player.
- You can only answer your own pending question.
- Custom text input mode times out after 60 seconds.

## Common failures

- `no pending question`: MineClawd is not currently waiting for your input.
- `invalid option`: use tab completion or a valid number.
- `not waiting for custom text input`: you called `cancel` outside custom mode.
