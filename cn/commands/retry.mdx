title: "retry"
description: "Retry the last failed request using a retry token."
---

## Purpose

Replay a failed request without retyping the prompt.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd retry <token>
```

## Where the token comes from

When a request fails, MineClawd can show clickable `[Retry]` and `[Adjust Prompt]` actions. Use the token behind `[Retry]`.

## Behavior and limits

- Retry tokens expire after 30 minutes.
- Retry only works when your active session still matches the original failed session.
- If retry starts successfully, MineClawd clears the stored failed token.

## Common failures

- `retry token is invalid or expired`: request failed too long ago or token is wrong.
- `active session changed`: resume the original session or resend manually.
- `another request is still running for this session`: wait for completion.
