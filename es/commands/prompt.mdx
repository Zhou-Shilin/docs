title: "prompt"
description: "Send a natural-language request to MineClawd."
---

## Purpose

Use this command to ask MineClawd to do work for you.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd prompt <request>
/mclawd <request>
```

## When to use it

Use this for normal day-to-day requests, such as world edits, command tasks, or KubeJS automation.

## Examples

```bash
/mclawd build a 9x9 wheat farm next to me
/mineclawd prompt create a server script that announces when a player sleeps
```

## Behavior and limits

- MineClawd validates your provider config before it starts.
- MineClawd creates or reuses your active session automatically.
- MineClawd allows one active request per session owner at a time.
- Prompt echo and task status visibility follow your `broadcast-requests-to` setting.

## Common failures

- `OpenAI API Key is missing` or `Vertex AI API Key is missing`: set credentials in config.
- `another request is still running for this session`: wait for completion, then retry.
