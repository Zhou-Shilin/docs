title: "sessions new"
description: "Create and switch to a new MineClawd session."
---

## Purpose

Create a fresh session so new tasks do not mix with old context.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd sessions new
```

## When to use it

Use this before a new project, a different play style, or a different objective.

## Examples

```bash
/mineclawd sessions new
```

## Behavior and limits

- The new session becomes your active session immediately.
- Initial title is `New Session` and may be auto-renamed after first response.
- Session id is a short 4-character id, and token format is `<id>-<title-slug>`.

## Common failures

- `cannot create a new session while a request is running`: wait for current task to finish.
- `failed to create session`: check write access to `mineclawd/sessions/`.
