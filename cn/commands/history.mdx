title: "history"
description: "Open a readable in-game book view of current session history."
---

## Purpose

View your active session conversation in a written book UI.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd history
```

## When to use it

Use this to review context before continuing a long task.

## Behavior and limits

- This command must be executed by a player, not console.
- Client support is required for the direct history book UI packet.
- If there is no active session, MineClawd asks you to create one first.
- Very long history is truncated to book limits.

## Common failures

- `this command must be executed by a player`: run in player chat.
- `Client mod is required for /mineclawd history book UI`: install MineClawd on your client.
- `No active session`: run `/mineclawd sessions new` first.
