title: "sessions repair"
description: "Repair malformed Vertex function-call turns in session history."
---

## Purpose

Repair a session when Vertex function-call turns become malformed.

## Syntax

```bash
/mineclawd sessions repair
/mineclawd sessions repair <session>
```

## When to use it

Use this after tool-call mismatch errors in Vertex-backed sessions.

## Examples

```bash
/mineclawd sessions repair
/mineclawd sessions repair 1a2b
```

## Behavior and limits

- Without `<session>`, MineClawd repairs the active session.
- With `<session>`, MineClawd repairs the referenced session.
- If no repair is needed, MineClawd reports that state and changes nothing.

## Common failures

- `session not found`: verify reference with `/mineclawd sessions list`.
- `cannot repair sessions while a request is running`: wait for completion.
